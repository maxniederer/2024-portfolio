title: Eric Trimbur
desc: Eric wanted to stop paying for Squarespace, so I built him a new website. He asked for a site to host his project writeups and blog posts, so I used Eleventy as the static site generator with Decap CMS for easy content management. I used Netlify for hosting and configured his existing domain with Squarespace DNS to link to his new, free site.
